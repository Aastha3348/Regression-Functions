# Regression-Functions
This repository explain the types of Regression functions along with  codes to implement them.

## Cubic Function
  - <B> Cubic function </B> is implemented in Regression when the line through plotted data points curves one way and then the other.
  - A <B> Cubic curve </B> when fitted to a ddataset passes through larger number data points in comparison to quadratic and linear plots.
## Quadratic function
  - A <B> Quadratic function </B> in regression is a way to model a relationship between two sets of variables by finding the equation of the parabola that best fits the data set.
  - The result can be used to make predictions about the data.
  - This result is a regression equation in the form :
  
                                     y=ax^2+bx+c ; where a≠0 
  
  that can be used to make predictions about the data.
  
## Exponential function
  - An <B> Exponential function </B> in regression is the process of finding the equation of the exponential function that fits best for a set of data. 
  - The equation is in the form  :
  
                                     y = ab^x or y = Ae^(kx)
 
  
## Logarithmic function
  - The <B> logarithmic function </B> in regression are used to predict y-values that lie inside or outside the plotted values.
  - They are in the form :
  
                                           y = ln(x)
  
  - Logarithmic functions can be transformed to be a linear based regression.
  - Logarithmic regressions are widely used to model environmental data.
  
## Sigmoidal/Logistic function
  - A <B> Sigmoidal function </B> is a step function used in Logistic Regression.
  - It is represesnted by 'σ' and calculated as :
  
                                    y cap = σ((θ^T)x).
                                    
  - This function maps any real value into another value between 0 and 1.
